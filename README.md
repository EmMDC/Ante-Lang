# [Ante](https://github.com/EmMDC/Ante-lang)

I recently started playing balatro, and it has become an addiction of mine. I sleep, thinking about the best combinations to get the highest scores possible. This has led me to combine my current obsession with this assignment and the creation of Ante! Ante is a playing card/poker-themed programming language designed to bring a little fun to your coding. It’s a language that combines the flexibility and power of Python and JavaScript with a poker-inspired syntax that’s meant to be playful, yet functional.
